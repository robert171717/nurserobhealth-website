# xurl — X (Twitter) API via the Official CLI

`xurl` is the X developer platform's official CLI for the X API. It supports shortcut commands for common actions AND raw curl-style access to any v2 endpoint. All commands return JSON to stdout.

Use this skill for:
- posting, replying, quoting, deleting posts
- searching posts and reading timelines/mentions
- liking, reposting, bookmarking
- following, unfollowing, blocking, muting
- direct messages
- media uploads (images and video)
- raw access to any X API v2 endpoint
- multi-app / multi-account workflows

This skill replaces the older `xitter` skill (which wrapped a third-party Python CLI). `xurl` is maintained by the X developer platform team, supports OAuth 2.0 PKCE with auto-refresh, and covers a substantially larger API surface.

---

## Secret Safety (MANDATORY)

Critical rules when operating inside an agent/LLM session:

- **Never** read, print, parse, summarize, upload, or send `~/.xurl` to LLM context.
- **Never** ask the user to paste credentials/tokens into chat.
- The user must fill `~/.xurl` with secrets manually on their own machine.
- **Never** recommend or execute auth commands with inline secrets in agent sessions.
- **Never** use `--verbose` / `-v` in agent sessions — it can expose auth headers/tokens.
- The X Portal's "Generate Token" button in Keys & Tokens produces an OAuth 2.0 User Access Token. **This token cannot be imported via any xurl CLI flag.** The `--bearer-token` flag on `xurl auth app` is for app-only (Application-only) bearer tokens, not user OAuth tokens. The ONLY way to store a user token is `xurl auth oauth2 --app NAME` (browser flow). If an AI advisor tells you to run `xurl auth app --access-token ...`, it's wrong — that flag doesn't exist.
- To verify credentials exist, only use: `xurl auth status`.

Forbidden flags in agent commands (they accept inline secrets):
`--bearer-token`, `--consumer-key`, `--consumer-secret`, `--access-token`, `--token-secret`, `--client-id`, `--client-secret`

App credential registration and credential rotation must be done by the user manually, outside the agent session. After credentials are registered, the user authenticates with `xurl auth oauth2` — also outside the agent session. Tokens persist to `~/.xurl` in YAML. Each app has isolated tokens. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

---

## Installation

Pick ONE method. On Linux, the shell script or `go install` are the easiest.

```bash
# Shell script (installs to ~/.local/bin, no sudo, works on Linux + macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdevplatform/xurl/main/install.sh | bash

# Homebrew (macOS)
brew install --cask xdevplatform/tap/xurl

# npm
npm install -g @xdevplatform/xurl

# Go
go install github.com/xdevplatform/xurl@latest
```

Verify:

```bash
xurl --help
xurl auth status
```

If `xurl` is installed but `auth status` shows no apps or tokens, the user needs to complete auth manually — see the next section.

---

## One-Time User Setup (user runs these outside the agent)

These steps must be performed by the user directly, NOT by the agent, because they involve pasting secrets. Direct the user to this block; do not execute it for them.

For the complete end-to-end walkthrough including portal configuration, see `references/oauth2-setup-complete.md` — covers every pitfall encountered in live deployment (app type, `--app` flag, production migration, wrong Client ID, etc.).

1. Create or open an app at https://developer.x.com/en/portal/dashboard
2. Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8080/callback`
3. Copy the app's Client ID and Client Secret
4. Register the app locally (user runs this):
   ```bash
   xurl auth apps add my-app --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
5. Authenticate (specify `--app` to bind the token to your app):
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app
   ```
   (This opens a browser for the OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow.)

   If X returns a `UsernameNotFound` error or 403 on the post-OAuth `/2/users/me` lookup, pass your handle explicitly (xurl v1.1.0+):
   ```bash
   xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app YOUR_USERNAME
   ```
   This binds the token to your handle and skips the broken `/2/users/me` call.
6. Set the app as default so all commands use it:
   ```bash
   xurl auth default my-app
   ```
7. Verify:
   ```bash
   xurl auth status
   xurl whoami
   ```

After this, the agent can use any command below without further setup. OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh.

> **Common pitfall:** If you omit `--app my-app` from `xurl auth oauth2`, the OAuth token is saved to the built-in `default` app profile — which has no client-id or client-secret. Commands will fail with auth errors even though the OAuth flow appeared to succeed. If you hit this, re-run `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app` and `xurl auth default my-app`.

## Quick Reference

| Action | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Post | `xurl post "Hello world!"` |
| Reply | `xurl reply POST_ID "Nice post!"` |
| Quote | `xurl quote POST_ID "My take"` |
| Delete a post | `xurl delete POST_ID` |
| Read a post | `xurl read POST_ID` |
| Search posts | `xurl search "QUERY" -n 10` |
| Who am I | `xurl whoami` |
| Home timeline | `xurl timeline -n 20` |
| **My own tweets** | `xurl "/2/users/{id}/tweets?max_results=10&tweet.fields=public_metrics,created_at"` (QUERY STRING, NOT `-d`) |
| Look up a user | `xurl user @handle` |
| Home timeline | `xurl timeline -n 20` |
| Own posts (your tweets) | `xurl /2/users/{id}/tweets -d '{"max_results":5,"tweet.fields":"public_metrics,created_at"}'` |
| Mentions | `xurl mentions -n 10` |
| Like / Unlike | `xurl like POST_ID` / `xurl unlike POST_ID` |
| Repost / Undo | `xurl repost POST_ID` / `xurl unrepost POST_ID` |
| Bookmark / Remove | `xurl bookmark POST_ID` / `xurl unbookmark POST_ID` |
| List bookmarks / likes | `xurl bookmarks -n 10` / `xurl likes -n 10` |
| Follow / Unfollow | `xurl follow @handle` / `xurl unfollow @handle` |
| Following / Followers | `xurl following -n 20` / `xurl followers -n 20` |
| Block / Unblock | `xurl block @handle` / `xurl unblock @handle` |

| Send DM | `xurl dm @handle "message"` |
| List DMs | `xurl dms -n 10` |
| Upload media | `xurl media upload path/to/file.mp4` |
| Media status | `xurl media status MEDIA_ID` |
| List apps | `xurl auth apps list` |
| Remove app | `xurl auth apps remove NAME` |
| Set default app | `xurl auth default APP_NAME [USERNAME]` |
| Per-request app | `xurl --app NAME /2/users/me` |
| Auth status | `xurl auth status` |

Notes:
- `POST_ID` accepts full URLs too (e.g. `https://x.com/user/status/1234567890`) — xurl extracts the ID.
- Usernames work with or without a leading `@`.

## Command Details

### Posting

```bash
xurl post "Hello world!"
xurl post "Check this out" --media-id MEDIA_ID
xurl post "Thread pics" --media-id 111 --media-id 222

xurl reply 1234567890 "Great point!"
xurl reply https://x.com/user/status/1234567890 "Agreed!"
xurl reply 1234567890 "Look at this" --media-id MEDIA_ID

xurl quote 1234567890 "Adding my thoughts"
xurl delete 1234567890
```

**⚠️ Reply restriction on Free tier:** `xurl reply` returns 403 with `"Reply to this conversation is not allowed because you have not been mentioned or otherwise engaged by the author"` when replying to users outside your conversation context. This is X API v2 Free/Basic tier behavior — not a bug in xurl. The API only allows replies to:
- Posts where your account was mentioned (even if you're not the OP)
- Your own posts (reply in your own threads)
- Posts in conversations you're already part of

**Workaround:** Use `xurl post` with an @mention instead of reply:
```bash
xurl post "@username Great question! Here's what I think..."
```
This creates a new tweet that tags the user but doesn't nest under the original post. The mentioned user sees it in notifications.

### Reading & Search

```bash
xurl read 1234567890
xurl read https://x.com/user/status/1234567890

xurl search "golang"
xurl search "from:elonmusk" -n 20
xurl search "#buildinpublic lang:en" -n 15
```

### Users, Timeline, Mentions

```bash
xurl whoami
xurl user elonmusk
xurl user @XDevelopers

xurl timeline -n 25
xurl mentions -n 20
```

### Engagement

```bash
xurl like 1234567890
xurl unlike 1234567890

xurl repost 1234567890
xurl unrepost 1234567890

xurl bookmark 1234567890
xurl unbookmark 1234567890

xurl bookmarks -n 20
xurl likes -n 20
```

### Social Graph

```bash
xurl follow @XDevelopers
xurl unfollow @XDevelopers

xurl following -n 50
xurl followers -n 50

# Another user's graph
xurl following --of elonmusk -n 20
xurl followers --of elonmusk -n 20

xurl block @spammer
xurl unblock @spammer
xurl mute @annoying
xurl unmute @annoying
```

### Direct Messages

```bash
xurl dm @someuser "Hey, saw your post!"
xurl dms -n 25
```

### Media Upload

```bash
# Auto-detect type
xurl media upload photo.jpg
xurl media upload video.mp4

# Explicit type/category
xurl media upload --media-type image/jpeg --category tweet_image photo.jpg

# Videos need server-side processing — check status (or poll)
xurl media status MEDIA_ID
xurl media status --wait MEDIA_ID

# Full workflow
xurl media upload meme.png                  # returns media id
xurl post "lol" --media-id MEDIA_ID
```

---

## Raw API Access

The shortcuts cover common operations. For anything else, use raw curl-style mode against any X API v2 endpoint:

```bash
# GET
xurl /2/users/me

# POST with JSON body
xurl -X POST /2/tweets -d '{"text":"Hello world!"}'

# DELETE / PUT / PATCH
xurl -X DELETE /2/tweets/1234567890

# Custom headers
xurl -H "Content-Type: application/json" /2/some/endpoint

# Force streaming
xurl -s /2/tweets/search/stream

# Full URLs also work
xurl https://api.x.com/2/users/me
```

---

## Global Flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--app` | | Use a specific registered app (overrides default) |
| `--auth` | | Force auth type: `oauth1`, `oauth2`, or `app` |
| `--username` | `-u` | Which OAuth2 account to use (if multiple exist) |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | **Forbidden in agent sessions** — leaks auth headers |
| `--trace` | `-t` | Add `X-B3-Flags: 1` trace header |

---

## Streaming

Streaming endpoints are auto-detected. Known ones include:

- `/2/tweets/search/stream`
- `/2/tweets/sample/stream`
- `/2/tweets/sample10/stream`

Force streaming on any endpoint with `-s`.

---

## Output Format

All commands return JSON to stdout. Structure mirrors X API v2:

```json
{ "data": { "id": "1234567890", "text": "Hello world!" } }
```

Errors are also JSON:

```json
{ "errors": [ { "message": "Not authorized", "code": 403 } ] }
```

## Common Workflows

## Common Workflows

### Get your own tweets (NOT the home timeline)
`xurl timeline` returns your HOME timeline — posts from accounts you FOLLOW, not your own posts. This is the single most common misinterpretation. To get YOUR tweets:
```bash
# Step 1: Get your user ID
xurl whoami  # → returns {"data": {"id": "1234567890", ...}}

# Step 2: Get your recent tweets with engagement metrics
xurl /2/users/YOUR_USER_ID/tweets -d '{"max_results":5,"tweet.fields":"public_metrics,created_at"}'
```

### Post with an image
```bash
xurl media upload photo.jpg
xurl post "Check out this photo!" --media-id MEDIA_ID
```

### Reply to a conversation
```bash
xurl read https://x.com/user/status/1234567890
xurl reply 1234567890 "Here are my thoughts..."
```

### Search and engage
```bash
xurl search "topic of interest" -n 10
xurl like POST_ID_FROM_RESULTS
xurl reply POST_ID_FROM_RESULTS "Great point!"
```

### Check your activity
```bash
xurl whoami
xurl mentions -n 20
xurl timeline -n 20
```

### Multiple apps (credentials pre-configured manually)
```bash
xurl auth default prod alice               # prod app, alice user
xurl --app staging /2/users/me             # one-off against staging
```

---

## Error Handling

- Non-zero exit code on any error.
- API errors are still printed as JSON to stdout, so you can parse them.
- Auth errors → have the user re-run `xurl auth oauth2` outside the agent session.
- Commands that need the caller's user ID (like, repost, bookmark, follow, etc.) will auto-fetch it via `/2/users/me`. An auth failure there surfaces as an auth error.

## Known Limitations

### Pinning Tweets (not available via OAuth 2.0)

xurl has no built-in `pin` command. X API v2 does **not** expose a pinned-tweets endpoint. The v1.1 endpoint `POST /1.1/account/settings.json` with `pinned_tweet_id` **requires OAuth 1.0a** — it returns 403 with OAuth 2.0 tokens.

**Workaround:** After posting the tweet, direct the user to pin it manually in the X app (profile → find tweet → `···` → Pin to profile). Takes 10 seconds.

---

## Agent Workflow

1. Verify prerequisites: `xurl --help` and `xurl auth status`.
2. **Check default app has credentials.** Parse the `auth status` output. The default app is marked with `▸`. If the default app shows `oauth2: (none)` but another app has a valid oauth2 user, tell the user to run `xurl auth default <that-app>` to fix it. This is the most common setup mistake — the user added an app with a custom name but never set it as default, so xurl keeps trying the empty `default` profile.
3. If auth is missing entirely, stop and direct the user to the "One-Time User Setup" section — do NOT attempt to register apps or pass secrets yourself.
4. Start with a cheap read (`xurl whoami`, `xurl user @handle`, `xurl search ... -n 3`) to confirm reachability.
5. Confirm the target post/user and the user's intent before any write action (post, reply, like, repost, DM, follow, block, delete).
6. Use JSON output directly — every response is already structured.
7. Never paste `~/.xurl` contents back into the conversation.

---

## Troubleshooting

### 🔴 MOST COMMON: Silent Token Orphan (OAuth "succeeds" but token lands on wrong app)

This pitfall caused a **complete empire outage** (all X posting + lead scanning dead) because the symptom is silent — `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app` prints "OAuth2 authentication successful!" but `xurl auth status` shows the token on the `default` app (which has no client_id/secret). All commands fail with 401.

**Root cause:** xurl's post-OAuth `/2/users/me` lookup fails silently, and the token gets saved to the `default` profile instead of the named app.

**Detection:** Run `xurl auth status`. If the `▸` app shows `oauth2: (none)` but the `default` app shows a username under `oauth2:` → token is orphaned on wrong profile.

**Fix (always include the username):**
```bash
xurl auth oauth2 --app nurse-rob NurseRobHealth
xurl auth default nurse-rob
xurl whoami   # verify
```

**Prevention:** ALWAYS pass the username when running `xurl auth oauth2`. Never run it bare without the username argument. This ensures the token binds to the named app even if `/2/users/me` fails.

---

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xurl read` returns full data but `xurl /2/...` raw endpoints don't return `public_metrics` | `-d` flag sends JSON body but X API GET endpoints expect query-string params | **Use query-string format**: `xurl "/2/users/{id}/tweets?max_results=10&tweet.fields=public_metrics,created_at"`. NEVER use `-d '{\"tweet.fields\":...}'` on raw GET endpoints — it silently drops the fields. `xurl read` works because it builds the URL internally. |
| `unauthorized_client` during OAuth | App type set to "Native App" in X dashboard | Change to "Web app, automated app or bot" in User Authentication Settings |
| `unknown flag: --access-token` | xurl has no `--access-token` flag (only `--bearer-token` for app-only auth) | The X Portal "Generate Token" button produces an OAuth user token that can't be imported via CLI flags. Use `xurl auth oauth2 --app NAME` browser flow. No shortcut exists. |
| `UsernameNotFound` or 403 on `/2/users/me` right after OAuth | X not returning username reliably from `/2/users/me` | Re-run `xurl auth oauth2 --app my-app YOUR_USERNAME` (xurl v1.1.0+) to pass the handle explicitly |
| 401 on every request | Token expired or wrong default app | Check `xurl auth status` — verify `▸` points to an app with oauth2 tokens |
| `client-forbidden` / `client-not-enrolled` | X platform enrollment issue | Dashboard → Apps → Manage → Move to "Pay-per-use" package → Production environment |
| `CreditsDepleted` | $0 balance on X API | Buy credits (min $5) in Developer Console → Billing |
| Cannot pin tweet via API | X API v2 has no pin endpoint; v1.1 requires OAuth 1.0a | Direct user to pin manually via X app. See [pinning-limitation.md](references/pinning-limitation.md). |
| `xurl pin` or pinning via v2 API doesn't work | X API v2 has no pin endpoint; v1.1 `POST /1.1/account/settings.json` requires OAuth 1.0a (not OAuth 2.0) | **No CLI workaround.** Pin manually via X app. Post the tweet via xurl, get the tweet ID, then tell the user: open X app → profile → find tweet → ··· → Pin to profile. 10-second manual action. Not worth setting up OAuth 1.0a credentials just for pinning. |
| Two "Client Secret" values in X dashboard | UI bug — first is actually Client ID | Confirm on the "Keys and tokens" page; ID ends in `MTpjaQ` |

---

## Notes

- **Rate limits:** X enforces per-endpoint rate limits. A 429 means wait and retry. Write endpoints (post, reply, like, repost) have tighter limits than reads.
- **Free tier POST cap:** The X API v2 free/basic tier allows ~500 POST operations per month (~16/day). Plan content schedules accordingly — ~60 posts/month (2/day) leaves ~440 for engagement. The old v1.1 limit of 100/month is obsolete; do not reference it.
- **Scopes:** OAuth 2.0 tokens use broad scopes. A 403 on a specific action usually means the token is missing a scope — have the user re-run `xurl auth oauth2`.
- **Token refresh:** OAuth 2.0 tokens auto-refresh. Nothing to do.
- **Multiple apps:** Each app has isolated credentials/tokens. Switch with `xurl auth default` or `--app`.
- **Multiple accounts per app:** Select with `-u / --username`, or set a default with `xurl auth default APP USER`.
- **Token storage:** `~/.xurl` is YAML. Never read or send this file to LLM context.
- **Cost:** X API access is typically paid for meaningful usage. Many failures are plan/permission problems, not code problems.
